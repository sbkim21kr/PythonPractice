# ⚔️ Git Merge Conflict Resolution Guide

This guide explains how to simulate and resolve a merge conflict in Git when two branches modify the same part of the same file differently.

---

## 🧠 What Is a Merge Conflict?

A **merge conflict** occurs when:
> Two branches change the same part of the same file in different ways.

Git can't decide which version to keep, so it asks you to resolve the conflict manually.

---

## 🧪 Conflict Simulation Scenario

### 🔧 Step 1: Modify the welcome message in `main` branch
```bash
git switch main
sed -i '' "s/간단한 계산기입니다./파이썬으로 만든 간단한 계산기입니다./" main.py
git add main.py
git commit -m "docs: Update welcome message"
```

### 🔧 Step 2: Modify the same line differently in a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature-welcome-message-update
sed -i '' "s/파이썬으로 만든 간단한 계산기입니다./Welcome to Simple Calculator!/" main.py
git add main.py
git commit -m "docs: Change welcome message to English"
```

### 🔧 Step 3: Try merging the feature branch into `main`
```bash
git switch main
git merge feature-welcome-message-update
```

💥 **Conflict occurs!** Git can't automatically merge the changes.

## 🛠️ How to Resolve the Conflict

### ✅ Step 1: Check conflict status
```bash
git status
```
Output: `both modified: main.py`

### ✅ Step 2: Open the conflicted file
```bash
cat main.py
```
You’ll see conflict markers like this:
```python
<<<<<<< HEAD
print("파이썬으로 만든 간단한 계산기입니다.")
=======
print("Welcome to Simple Calculator!")
>>>>>>> feature-welcome-message-update
```

### ✅ Step 3: Edit the file manually
Open the file in VS Code or any editor:
```bash
code .
```
Choose the final version and remove conflict markers.  
Example:
```python
print("파이썬으로 만든 간단한 계산기입니다. (Welcome!)")
```

### ✅ Step 4: Commit the resolved file
```bash
git add main.py
git commit -m "fix: Resolve conflict and unify welcome message"
```

### ✅ Step 5: Clean up the feature branch
```bash
git branch -d feature-welcome-message-update
```

## 🧰 Optional Tools

- Run Git’s built-in merge tool:
  ```bash
  git mergetool
  ```

- Use VS Code’s Git extension for visual conflict resolution:
  ```bash
  code .
  ```

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Merge conflicts are common in team projects. Knowing how to resolve them:
- Keeps your codebase clean
- Prevents overwriting others’ work
- Builds confidence in collaborative development
