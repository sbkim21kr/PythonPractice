cp -r dist/* .

🧠 Literal Breakdown
Part	Meaning
cp	The copy command
-r	Recursive — copies directories and their contents
dist/*	All files and folders inside the dist directory
.	The current directory (where you're running the command)

git rm -rf .
🧠 Literal Breakdown
Part	Meaning
git	You're using a Git command
rm	Git's built-in remove command — deletes files from the repo
-r	Recursive — removes directories and their contents
-f	Force — skips confirmation prompts and forces deletion
.	Refers to the current directory — meaning all files and folders

🌐 What This Class Note Covers: GitHub Pages Deployment

GitHub Pages is a free service that lets you host static websites directly from your GitHub repository — perfect for portfolios, documentation, or frontend apps.

🧾 Step-by-Step Breakdown
🏗️ 1. Create a gh-pages branch
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .

--orphan creates a new branch with no commit history.

git rm -rf . deletes all files so you can start fresh with just your build output.


📦 2. Add your built files
cp -r dist/* .
git add .
git commit -m "GitHub Pages 배포"

Copies your static site files (e.g., from dist/) into the root.
Commits them to the gh-pages branch.

🚀 3. Push to GitHub
git push origin gh-pages
Uploads the gh-pages branch to your GitHub repository.

⚙️ 4. Configure GitHub Pages

    Go to your repo’s Settings → Pages

    Choose gh-pages as the source branch

    GitHub will publish your site at:
    https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/
    

🧱 Why This Works for GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages expects:

    A branch (like gh-pages) with only static files at the root

    No .py, .ipynb, or source code — just the final output (HTML, CSS, JS)

So the flow looks like this:

    You build your site (e.g., using a Python script or Jupyter notebook)

    The output goes into dist/

    You switch to gh-pages, clear it, and copy only the contents of dist/

    You push that to GitHub — and GitHub Pages serves it as a website

The dist/ folder is like your “ready-to-ship” box 📦. You build your project (whether it’s HTML, CSS, JS, or exported from a notebook), and then you place only the final, static files into dist/.

When you publish a static site using GitHub Pages (via the gh-pages branch), GitHub only serves the built static files — like index.html, style.css, and script.js. It does not expose your Python code, notebooks, or source files directly on the website.

Let’s say you built a Python app that generates interactive charts:

    Your README.md explains:

        What the app does

        How to install it

        How to run it

        What technologies you used

    Your GitHub Pages site shows the charts live — so people can interact with them without installing anything.
