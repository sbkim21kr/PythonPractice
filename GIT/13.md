# Git Flow 초기화
git flow init


Git Flow will prompt you to name the branches it will use for your workflow. It’s an interactive setup that asks:
You’ll be prompted to name your branches:

    main → for production

    develop → for active development

    feature/ → for new features

    release/ → for prepping releases

    hotfix/ → for emergency fixes




# 새 기능 시작
git flow feature start contact-form

# 기능 완료
git flow feature finish contact-form

# 릴리즈 시작
git flow release start 1.0.0

This command creates a new branch:
It’s based on your develop branch, which contains all the finished features you’ve been working on.
🧠 Why Start a Release?

    You’ve finished building features (e.g., contact form, login page)

    You want to polish the code before deploying

    You need to bump version numbers, update docs, or run final tests

🧾 What You Typically Do in a Release Branch
Task	Example
✅ Final testing	Run pytest, manual QA
📝 Update documentation	Edit README.md, changelog
🔢 Bump version numbers	Change __version__ = "1.0.0"
🧹 Minor cleanup	Remove unused code, fix typos
📦 Prepare packaging	Add setup files, Docker configs, etc.


# 릴리즈 완료
git flow release finish 1.0.0
🎯 What Happens When You Finish the Release?

    Merges release/1.0.0 into both main and develop

    Tags the commit as v1.0.0

    Deletes the release/1.0.0 branch

Now your main branch is ready for deployment, and your develop branch stays up-to-date.

🧭 Summary
Command	Purpose
