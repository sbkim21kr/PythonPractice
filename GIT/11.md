You're welcome, Sangbum! Here's a clean, well-organized `.md` (Markdown) file that explains both `flake8` and `pytest` — perfect for your class notes or GitHub documentation:

# 🧪 Python Code Quality and Testing: flake8 & pytest

This guide explains how to use `flake8` and `pytest` — two essential tools for writing clean, reliable Python code.

---

## 🧼 flake8 — Linting Tool for Python

### 🧠 What Is flake8?
`flake8` checks your code for:
- Syntax errors
- Style violations (PEP 8)
- Code complexity
- Unused imports or variables

It combines:
- `pyflakes` (logic errors)
- `pycodestyle` (style guide)
- `mccabe` (complexity checker)

### ✅ Why Use flake8?
- Keeps code readable and consistent
- Prevents bugs caused by sloppy syntax
- Helps teams follow shared coding standards

### 🧪 Example Usage
```bash
flake8 main.py
```

### 🔍 Sample Output
```
main.py:10:1: F401 'os' imported but unused
main.py:15:80: E501 line too long (85 > 79 characters)
```

## 🧪 pytest — Python Testing Framework

### 🧠 What Is pytest?
`pytest` runs your unit tests and reports:
- Which tests passed or failed
- What errors occurred
- Test coverage (with plugins)

### ✅ Why Use pytest?
- Ensures your code works as expected
- Catches bugs early
- Supports fixtures, parameterized tests, and plugins

### 🧪 Example Usage
```bash
pytest
```

### 🔍 Sample Test
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
```

## 🧠 Why Use Both Together?

| Tool     | Purpose               | Benefit                         |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `flake8` | Code quality & style   | Prevents bad code from merging  |
| `pytest` | Functional correctness | Ensures code does what it should|

Together, they help you write **clean, reliable, professional-grade Python code**.

---

## 🚀 Bonus: Automate with GitHub Actions

You can run both tools automatically using a `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` file:
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    pip install flake8 pytest
    if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi

- name: Lint with flake8
  run: flake8 .

- name: Test with pytest
  run: pytest
```

---

Keep your code clean and your tests green! 🧼✅
```
