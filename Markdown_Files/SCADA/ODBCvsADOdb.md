Got it! Your class is using **two different database interfaces**â€”**ODBC** and **ADOdb**â€”to connect to **MS SQL Server** and **MySQL**, respectively. Letâ€™s break down what each one does and why they might be used differently:

---

### ðŸ”Œ 1. **ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)**
- **Used for**: Connecting to **MS SQL Server**
- **Why**: ODBC is a **universal driver standard** supported natively by Microsoft. It works well with SCADA systems, Excel, and Windows-based applications.
- **How it works**:
  - Uses a **DSN (Data Source Name)** or connection string
  - Sends SQL queries like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, etc.
  - Ideal for **real-time data logging**, **reporting**, and **SCADA integration**

---

### ðŸ§  2. **ADOdb (ActiveX Data Objects for Databases)**
- **Used for**: Connecting to **MySQL**
- **Why**: ADOdb is a **PHP-based abstraction library** that simplifies database access across different platforms.
- **How it works**:
  - Wraps around native drivers (like `mysqli`, `pdo_mysql`)
  - Offers a consistent API for multiple databases
  - Often used in **web-based dashboards**, **HMIs**, or **custom SCADA web portals**

---

### ðŸ§© Why Use Both?

| Interface | Database | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **ODBC**  | MS SQL Server | SCADA integration, Windows apps, Excel reports |
| **ADOdb** | MySQL         | Web dashboards, PHP-based tools, cross-platform access |

Using both lets your system:
- Connect to **industrial-grade databases** (MS SQL) for control and logging
- Connect to **lightweight or cloud-based databases** (MySQL) for visualization or remote access
