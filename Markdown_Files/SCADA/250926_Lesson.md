Great question! Let's break down the differences between **Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL)** and **MySQL**, especially in the context of SCADA systems and scripting.

### ðŸ§  Core Differences Between MS SQL and MySQL

| Feature | **MS SQL Server** | **MySQL** |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Developer** | Microsoft | Oracle (originally developed by MySQL AB) |
| **Platform Integration** | Deeply integrated with Windows and .NET | Cross-platform, widely used with PHP, Python, etc. |
| **Database Access** | Often accessed via OLE DB or native SQL Server drivers | Typically accessed via ODBC or MySQL connectors |
| **Schema Usage** | Uses schemas, but often defaults to `dbo` unless specified | Requires explicit database name in queries or connection string |
| **Authentication** | Supports Windows Authentication and SQL Authentication | Uses MySQL user accounts and passwords |
| **Tooling** | SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) | MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, etc. |

### ðŸ”§ In SCADA Scripting Context

- **MS SQL Server**:
  - You can often connect using Windows credentials.
  - If you're using VBScript or a SCADA scripting engine, you might not need to explicitly state the database name in every query if it's already defined in the connection string.
  - Example:  
    ```vb
    conn.Open "Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=SERVER;Initial Catalog=MyDB;Integrated Security=SSPI;"
    ```

- **MySQL**:
  - You **must** specify the database name in the connection string and often in the query itself.
  - Uses ODBC drivers like `MySQL ODBC 5.3 ANSI Driver`.
  - Example:  
    ```vb
    conn.Open "Driver=MySQL ODBC 5.3 ANSI Driver;Server=127.0.0.1;Database=cimondb;User=cimondb;Password=xxx;"
    ```

- **ADODB**:
  - Both MS SQL and MySQL can be accessed using `ADODB.Connection` and `ADODB.Recordset` in VBScript.
  - Itâ€™s not exclusive to MySQLâ€”MS SQL also supports it.

### ðŸ§© Summary

- Both MS SQL and MySQL use **schemas**, but MS SQL often hides this behind the default `dbo` unless you explicitly use others.
- **MySQL requires more explicit database naming**, especially in SCADA scripts.
- **ADODB is a data access method**, not specific to MySQL.
- MS SQL may feel more seamless in Windows environments, while MySQL is more manual but flexible across platforms.

If you're working in SCADA and switching between these, it's important to tailor your connection and query syntax to the database you're targeting. Want help writing a cross-compatible script?
