It's fantastic to have all your background information consolidated! Your journey is truly impressive and positions you uniquely for a successful career transition into MES engineering. Combining your mechanical engineering, advanced mathematics, extensive business experience, new MES technical skills, strong English, and Japanese proficiency creates a very compelling profile.

Let's synthesize all this into a comprehensive action plan and refine the Udemy course recommendations for your final project and job search.

### Comprehensive Action Plan for Your Career Transition

1.  **Refine Your Narrative:**
    *   **Your "Why":** Clearly articulate *why* you're making this switch. It's not just about the timber industry's decline, but your passion for problem-solving, efficiency, and leveraging technology (MES, Deep Learning) to optimize manufacturing, drawing parallels to the challenges you saw in sawmills.
    *   **Connect the Dots:** Explain how your diverse background (Mech E for systems thinking, Math for analytical rigor, Business for understanding operational needs and financial impact, Languages for global communication) makes you a *better* MES engineer. You're not just a technician; you're a strategic problem-solver.

2.  **Optimize Your Online Presence (LinkedIn is Key!):**
    *   **Professional Headshot:** Ensure you have a professional photo.
    *   **Compelling Headline:** Instead of just "MES Engineer Trainee," try something like: "MES Engineer | Bridging Business & Tech with Deep Learning & Automation | Mech E, Math, Python, Japanese Speaker."
    *   **"About" Section:** This is where your narrative shines. Weave in your journey, your passion for MES, your unique skill set, and your career aspirations. Highlight your English and Japanese proficiency here.
    *   **Skills Section:** List *all* relevant skills: Python, C#, OpenCV, YOLO, Deep Learning, SCADA, PLC (Melsec), EPLAN, SolidWorks, Cisco Networking, Pneumatics/Hydraulics, Project Management, Data Analysis, English, Japanese.
    *   **Experience Section:**
        *   **Timber Wholesaling:** Frame this to highlight transferable skills: "Managed international timber supply chains, navigated market fluctuations and currency risks, developed strong problem-solving and negotiation skills, gained deep understanding of industrial operations and financial pressures faced by manufacturers (e.g., sawmills)."
        *   **HRDK Training:** Detail the specific technologies and methodologies you're learning.
    *   **Education:** List CWRU and NYU prominently.
    *   **Recommendations:** If possible, get recommendations from HRDK instructors or even former business contacts who can speak to your work ethic and capabilities.

3.  **Networking Strategy (Aggressive & Targeted):**
    *   **LinkedIn Connections:**
        *   **Target Companies:** Identify foreign companies with MES/automation divisions in Seoul. Prioritize Japanese companies (Mitsubishi Electric, Panasonic, Omron, Keyence, Fanuc, Yaskawa, Hitachi, Toshiba, Fuji Electric) and other global players (Siemens, Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric, ABB, Honeywell, GE Digital).
        *   **Personalized Messages:** When connecting, mention your specific interest in MES, your unique background, and your language skills. "Hello [Name], I'm transitioning into MES engineering after 13 years in timber wholesaling, bringing a unique blend of business acumen, engineering, and new skills in Python/Deep Learning. I'm particularly interested in [Company Name]'s work in [specific area] and would appreciate connecting. I'm also proficient in Japanese."
        *   **Informational Interviews:** Request brief virtual coffee chats to learn about their work, company culture, and career paths. This is not a direct job ask, but a way to build relationships and gain insights.
    *   **HRDK Network:** Leverage your instructors and classmates for leads and advice.
    *   **Industry Events:** Attend virtual or in-person webinars/conferences on Industry 4.0, Smart Factories, MES, and AI in manufacturing.

4.  **Excel in Your Final Project (Your Portfolio Piece):**
    *   This project is your practical demonstration. Aim for excellence.
    *   **Scope:** Ensure it's robust enough to showcase your Deep Learning, OpenCV, and Python skills for quality assurance.
    *   **Documentation:** Create a professional report and a well-commented GitHub repository. Explain your methodology, model architecture, training process, results, and potential for industrial integration.
    *   **Presentation:** Prepare a clear and concise presentation of your project.

5.  **Prepare for Interviews:**
    *   **Behavioral Questions:** Practice articulating your career change, your motivations, and how your diverse background is an asset.
    *   **Technical Questions:** Be ready for questions on PLCs, SCADA, networking, Python, Deep Learning concepts, and how you'd approach a problem.
    *   **Language:** Be prepared to demonstrate your English and Japanese proficiency if applying to roles where these are required.

### Udemy Course Recommendations for Your Final Project (Python Focus)

Given your enjoyment of Python and your project's focus on Deep Learning for quality assurance with OpenCV and YOLO v3, these courses will be highly beneficial:

1.  **"Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning" by Jose Portilla:**
    *   **Why:** This is the *most critical* course for your project. It directly covers OpenCV for image processing, object detection (often including YOLO or similar architectures), and integrating Deep Learning for computer vision tasks. Jose Portilla is an excellent instructor, known for practical, hands-on content.
    *   **Relevance:** Will teach you how to implement your "pass/fail" sorting system using image data, from pre-processing to model training and inference.

2.  **"Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks" by Kirill Eremenko & Hadelin de Ponteves:**
    *   **Why:** Provides a strong foundational understanding of various Deep Learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are fundamental for image-based tasks. It uses Python (TensorFlow/Keras).
    *   **Relevance:** Solidifies your theoretical understanding of *why* certain models work for image classification and object detection, complementing the practical implementation from the OpenCV course.

3.  **"Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python" by Jose Portilla:**
    *   **Why:** Even if you're enjoying Python, this course is invaluable for ensuring you have a comprehensive understanding of Python's capabilities, best practices, and advanced features. A strong Python foundation is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable Deep Learning code.
    *   **Relevance:** Fills any potential gaps in your Python knowledge, making you more confident and effective in your project implementation.

4.  **"YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection with Darknet & OpenCV" (Search for updated versions, e.g., YOLOv5/v7/v8):**
    *   **Why:** While the "Python for Computer Vision" course will cover YOLO, a dedicated course can offer deeper insights into training custom YOLO models for specific datasets (like your "pass/fail" items), fine-tuning, and deployment considerations. Look for courses that cover more recent YOLO versions if possible, as they offer better performance, but understanding v3 is a great start.
    *   **Relevance:** Directly enhances your ability to implement the object detection aspect of your quality assurance system.

**Beyond the Core (Consider if time permits):**

*   **"TensorFlow 2.0: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence" by Jose Portilla:** If you want to dive deeper into TensorFlow/Keras for more complex Deep Learning models beyond what's covered in the A-Z course.
*   **"SCADA and PLC Industrial Automation" or similar:** While not for your *Deep Learning* project, understanding how your QA system would integrate into a larger MES/SCADA environment is crucial for interviews and demonstrating a holistic view.

Your journey is inspiring, and your proactive approach to learning and career change is commendable. With your unique blend of skills and experiences, you are well-positioned for success in the MES field. Keep pushing forward!
